#departurefunction.py
Calculates the departure functions for enthalpy and entropy using the Peng-Robinson equation of state

#fugacity.py
Calculate the fugacity of a fluid using the PR EOS (this is in essence the calculation of the departure function of Gibbs free energy)

#vaporpressure.py
Calculate the vapor pressure of a pure fluid using the PR EOS

#fugacity-mixture.py
Calculate the fugacity of every component in a mixture fluid using the PR EOS with the van der Waals one-fluid mixing rule
